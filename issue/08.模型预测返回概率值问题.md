> The predicted probability produced by random forests are the votes, i.e. the proportion of trees who voted for class 1. If you had 5 trees, your values could only be multiples of 0.2.

> On the other hand, if you have 1000 trees, the range of possible values for the probabilities will be the multiple of 0.001

```python
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(train_link_features, train_link_labels)
predict_value = model.predict_proba(test_link_features)[:, 1]   # 预测为正样本的概率
```
