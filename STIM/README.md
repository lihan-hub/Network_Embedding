## Implement of the following paper
> - [Predicting Disease Related microRNA Based on Similarity and Topology](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/8/11/1405)
## Description
> - We propose a machine learning method, called STIM, which uses network topology information to predict diseaseâ€“miRNA associations. In contrast to the conventional approach, STIM constructs features according to information on similarity and topology in networks and then uses a machine learning model to predict potential associations.
